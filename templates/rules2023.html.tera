                        A Swiss tournament will be played between all entrants (except ChangeOpening and SirKex). Each participant plays a 10-game match per round. A won game gives 1 point, a tie gives 0.5 points, and a lost game gives 0 points. Once either player reaches 5.5 points the players are allowed to stop there.

                        The number of rounds will be the base-2 logarithm of the number of participants, rounded down, plus two. So 32-63 players is 7 rounds, 64-127 players is 8 rounds, etc.

                        determined by placement in the previous rounds. ChangeOpening starts in the upper pool, and SirKex starts in the lower pool.

                                stage go into the “lower” Candidate pool. The players in 9th, 8th, 5th, 4th and 2nd place go into the “upper” Candidates pool.

                        Each candidate plays a 10-game match against each other candidate in their pool. A won game gives 1 point, a drawn game gives 0.5 points,

            <li>
                There will be a 1-week break between the Qualification and Candidates round, and between the Candidates round and Semifinal Matches.
            </li>
            <li>The pairings for the first matches will be published on Tuesday 3rd October.</li>
            <li>The pairings for all subsequent matches will be published on subsequent Tuesdays.</li>
            <li>All matches must be completed by the following Monday 23:59 UTC.</li>
        </ol>
    <li>Match negotiations
        <ol type="A">
            <li>
                Each player is responsible to offer at least 3 separate times for the match, by Friday 23:59 UTC at the latest, unless an offer has been accepted 
                before that number is reached.
            </li>
            <li>
                Players may begin negotiating a playing start time as soon as their next pairing is known. When a time is agreed on, it must be shared 
                in the pairings forum post.
            </li>
            <li>
                To prevent (most) time zone confusion, players must communicate their times in UTC.
            </li>
            <li>
                A player must be able to accept new messages while they are still included in pairings.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 3 offered times should be no closer than 3 hours to each other and no more than 2 on a single date.
            </li>
            <li>
                If 3 offers are not made in time the player at fault must accept a time chosen by the opponent.
            </li>
            <li>
                If both players fail to make 3 offers by the deadline then the match will count as a draw and both players will count as having forfeited 
                a game.
            </li>
            <li>
                A player should respond to an offer by accepting or making a different offer, preferably within 24 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                If both players make 3 offers but no agreement is made before the weekend then TDs will determine if fault lies with a particular player.
            </li>
            <li>
                If a player is at fault then their opponent will decide the match time, if no player is at fault then the match will be ruled as a draw.
            </li>
            <li>
                Case-by-case exceptions may be made to the aforementioned rules at the TDs’ discretion.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Match rules (applying at all stages)
        <ol type="A">
            <li>Each player has the right to call a break once during the match, between two games. The break lasts at most 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>
                If no break is called, a rematch must be offered and accepted immediately.
                Repeated failure in doing so leads to a forfeit.</li>
            <li>
                If a player is offline at the time of the match, they have a 10 minute grace period to come online and start the game. The appearing player has to message the TDs that their opponent did not show up and again 10 minutes afterwards if the opponent still didn’t show up. The appearing player has the choice to reschedule or claim a win. If the appearing playing does not claim a win and rescheduling fails, the match will be forfeited in favor of the appearing player.
            </li>
            <li>If a player leaves the match while it's still ongoing, they get 10 minutes to come back
                and this counts as their break. If they don't come back in time, their opponent gets the option
                to claim a win (similar to rule VI.C).</li>
            <li>If a player gets forfeited in two different matches, they get disqualified from the ACWC.</li>
            <li>After a match, the winning player is responsible for posting the results in the Pairings forum post unless the players have agreed otherwise, or a player is chat banned.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Reporting cheats
        <ol type="A">
            <li>
                Accusations of cheating must be made privately to the TDs. Any accusation in
                public will result in a disqualification of the accuser, regardless of whether
                the accusation was correct or not.
            </li>
            <li>
                If an accused player is found guilty, they will be disqualified from the
                tournament.
            </li>
            <li>
                If a player gets marked as engine/booster on Lichess during the ACWC but for
                non-ACWC games, they also get disqualified from the ACWC.
            </li>

                    <li>
                        If a player withdraws or gets disqualified from the Qualification, they will
                        not be included in later pairings. If they still have an uncompleted pairing,
                        their opponent wins this game.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the disqualification happens on grounds of an engine mark (not booster
                        mark), all of their finished games in the Qualification will be adjudicated
                        in favor of their opponents.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Candidates: If a player withdraws or gets disqualified from the Candidates, all of their
                games will be disregarded.
            </li>
            <li>
                Semifinal Matches: If a player withdraws or gets disqualified, the other players below them in their Candidate pool move up one 
                position in their placement in the Semifinal Matches.
            </li>
            <li>
                Final Matches: If a player withdraws or gets disqualified, the other players below them in the Semifinals and Candidates move
                up one position in their placement in the Final Matches. 
            </li>
        </ol>
